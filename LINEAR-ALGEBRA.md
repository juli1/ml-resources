 - Vector helps you organize number
 - Adding two vectors is like putting them together in one single line

 - î = unit vector on the x axis
 - Ĵ = unit vector on the y axis
 - ($\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$) are the basic of the coordinates system
 - think of the coordinates of a vector as scalars
   - the vector [3, -2] is in fact [3 * $\hat{i}$, -2 * $\hat{j}$]
 - Linear combination of vectors: $a * \vec{v} + b * \vec{w}$
   - $a$ and $b$ are two scalars 
   - the span of $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ is the combination of all their linear combination. In other words, all the potential vectors $a * \vec{v} + b * \vec{w}$
 - the basis of a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the full space
